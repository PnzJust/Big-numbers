# Big-numbers

This program performs operations on two types of numbers: integers and rational
It is a OOP project; so classes have been used, inside of which I have entered lists (but not STL)
We have overloaded operators: + - /% "GCD" >> << * for whole numbers and << >> + * "simplify" for rational numbers


I do not check the input data!!
